# Midterm Presentation

## Theme: Create a cell that can be felt, held, and dissected with human hands.

This project ultimately aims to help those with visual impairments better understand the anatomy of a cell.


For the most part of this project, initially, I will be using "Theoretical Modeling"

# The Plan

Conduct further research into what has already been accomplished with creating synthetic cells
Continue work done with materials
Refine work
Create finished model
